You can skip our detailed analysis of retirement stocks and go directly to read Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Tech Stocks To Consider.\\n\\nChalking out a financially secure retirement plan can be difficult, especially in times of financial volatility. According to a report published by Natixis Investment Managers, over 40% of the investors believe that retiring securely will be difficult, while 42% don’t take retirement as an option, considering their current financial situation.\\n\\nSafe dividend stocks with a strong history remain one of the best investment options for retirement even during volatile times. For example, shares of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) fell by 40% during the financial crisis of 2008, but the company paid regular dividends to shareholders during that time.\\n\\nAnother option to save enough money for retirement is to invest in growth stocks with strong upside potential.\\n\\nMoreover, businesses in nearly every sector deploy the recent technological advances, making way for tech stocks to rise. As reported by Deloitte, the tech industry is well-positioned to grow in 2021, given the current market situation. According to analysts, the EPS of tech stocks is expected to grow by 20% to 40% by 2025. Even during the global market meltdown in 2020 due to the Covid-19, the S&P 500’s technology index gained 43.89%, compared with other sectors such as financials and real estate which dipped 1.7% and 2.2%, respectively, as reported by S&P Global. Some of the notable and famous stocks for retirement include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO).\\n\\nOur Methodology:\\n\\nLet's analyze our list of the best retirement stocks. The companies mentioned below are the tech stocks selected on the basis of their dividend policy, future growth potential, and overall performance. In addition to this, we took into account hedge fund sentiment, analysts' ratings, and fundamentals while choosing these stocks.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nImage by pasja1000 from Pixabay\\n\\nWhy pay attention to hedge fund sentiment while choosing stocks?\\n\\nInsider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 86 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and July 2021, our monthly newsletter’s stock picks returned 186.1%, vs. 100.1% for the S&P 500 ETF (SPY). Our stock picks outperformed the market by more than 86 percentage points (see the details here). That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to. You can subscribe to our free newsletter on our homepage to receive our stories in your inbox.\\n\\nRetirement Stock Portfolio: 10 Safe Tech Stocks To Consider\\n\\n10. Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (NASDAQ:CMTL)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 13\\n\\nComtech Telecommunications Corp.

Here is what the firm has to say:\\n\\n“Even great companies can get too expensive. In early January, we sold our long-standing position in Accenture PLC after the company’s valuation exceeded 30 times next 12 months (NTM) earnings per share (EPS). We originally invested in Accenture at the launch of the FMI International strategy at a valuation below 15 times NTM EPS and held the stock for over ten years. We added to the holding numerous times in the early years, growing the position size to as high as 5.5% in late 2014, before dialing it back in recent years as the valuation became less compelling. It is one of the world’s largest information technology services firms, specializing in helping complex, global businesses navigate disruption, and focusing on next-generation services like digital, cloud, and security. For years, the investment allowed FMI to capture the inherently higher growth of technology-related industries (GDP+) without investing directly in pure “invention-oriented” technology companies. Through Accenture we were able to avoid some of the shortfalls of tech investing: technology obsolescence, short product cycles, and subpar return on invested capital (ROIC). It grew steadily, was solidly profitable, capital-light, and generated high returns, all while maintaining a rock-solid balance sheet. It compounded its business value for many years, outperforming the MSCI EAFE indices by over 450% during our holding period. Unfortunately, the market increasingly recognized the company’s positive attributes, and the stock’s discount to intrinsic value slowly evaporated. Despite our admiration for the business, it exceeded our valuation threshold. We will continue to follow the company closely for future opportunities.”\\n\\nClick to continue reading and see the Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Tech Stocks To Consider.\\n\\nSuggested articles:\\n\\nBest Stocks To Buy For Early Retirement 10 Best Cryptocurrencies to Buy for Early Retirement 15 Dividend Stocks People Buy for Early Retirement\\n\\nDisclosure. None. Retirement Stock Portfolio: 10 Safe Tech Stocks To Consider is originally published on Insider Monkey.\", 'Tuesday, September 14, 2021\\r\\n\\r\\nSome good news on the “inflation watch” front: following last week’s higher-than-expected Producer Price Index (PPI), which indicated inflation creep was here to stay, this morning’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) — basically the other side of this inflation read’s coin — came in lower than expected for August: +0.3% on headline, beneath the +0.4% expected and the +0.5% reported for July.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the first economic print we’ve seen in recent memory that’s not pointing directly to higher inflation hitting the U.S. economy. If we strip out volatile food & energy costs, the “core” CPI read, we see growth barely moving the needle last month: +0.1%, below the +0.3% anticipated and +0.3% reported the previous month. This is the lowest monthly core CPI figure since February of this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we pull back to look at the year-over-year numbers, headline CPI is +5.3% — 10 basis points below July’s year over year, which was the highest CPI growth we’d seen in 13 years. Core year over year dropped to +4.0%, lower than the +4.3% we saw for July. For some historical comparison, June’s +4.5% was the biggest core CPI year-over-year figure we had seen in 30 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat all this means in early trading is that investors may feel a sense of reprieve that the Fed will have to move quickly to sop up this runaway inflation we’ve been seeing. Maybe Fed Chair Powell, who has held firm that inflation in our economy was “transitory” and was likely to abate once supply-demand challenges were worked out. Used Cars, which had shot up 32% earlier this year, were -1.5% last month. Air fares dipped -0.1%.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, this also may depict a setback in Services during August, as the Delta variant swept through the South like the forest fires out West (or the hurricane flooding in the East). Meaning this read may have less to do with lowering costs and more to do with a temporary economic setback caused by yet another wave of the coronavirus, at least regionally. Now that vaccinations are at last gaining favor in certain sectors, we may see CPI numbers back up where they had been.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn any case, pre-market futures reversed on this release: from wallowing in the red, post-CPI we saw the Dow jump to +140 points, the S&P 500 +20 and the Nasdaq +65. Since then, we have seen these numbers cool a bit, but remain firmly in the green. Next week is the next meeting for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), and investors had been looking toward Powell’s press conference as the time we hear about a tapering timeline. Perhaps now they’ll reconsider.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 11am PT today, Apple AAPL is expected to unveil its latest iPhone — the 13. These events, basically yearly as they now are, are not quite the scintillating occurrences that move Apple’s share price and thus the market. Part of this is because Apple is now so gigantic it’s hard to make those big jumps any longer. Similarly for the iPhone itself — it’s such a universal tool these days, there are few surprises even possible to present. Apple has underperformed the S&P 500 year to date.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

If you want to skip our introduction to the technology billionaire and how his investments are shaping the world as we know today, then take a look at Bill Gates Portfolio: November 2023 Update - Top 5 Stocks.\\n\\nBill Gates' fame and money come via having caught on to the personal computing industry when the sector was in its infancy. His company, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the biggest technology companies in the world. At the root of Microsoft's success is the world changing computer science industry, which has managed to put a computer, in one form or the other, in the hands of millions of people worldwide.\\n\\nWhile Mr. Gates has moved away from his trillion dollar firm, 2023 has been a year shaped by his decisions. This applies to both the stock market and the broader technology scene. Mr. Gates and his relationship with OpenAI have contributed to the rise of the world's most heavily trained artificial intelligence model ChatGPT. In turn, ChatGPT's progress has injected fervor into technology stocks, which needed a pick me up after the devastation to the market ushered in 2022 through the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the monetary policy effects of the coronavirus era.\\n\\nAccording to the latest estimates, Bill Gates is currently worth $116 billion as of November 2023. Most of his wealth comes through his Microsoft shares, both indirectly and directly. Mr. Gates' capital is also held up in the investment firm Cascade Investment L.L.C., a private investment firm headquartered in Kirkland, Washington. Billionaires like Bill Gates don't just simply invest in companies or organizations through the money in their personally held bank accounts. Instead, they structure their investments through companies for several benefits. Cascade is closely related to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the two organizations share Cascade's chief investment officer Michael Larson.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nLike the Bill Gates Foundation, Cascade also files with the SEC. Its latest filing came in July 2023 and revealed that the firm had owned 9.8 million shares of AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN). The shares opened at $157 on July 28th, implying that Bill Gates' investment in the Floridian car retailer was worth approximately $1.5 billion as of the time of the filing. Since the holding was disclosed, the stock has dipped and the shares are currently trading for $131.97. Another investment of the financial firm, often also called Bill Gates' family office, is the Western Asset Inflation-Linked Income Fund (NYSE:WIA). This fund invests primarily in inflation linked securities issued by the U.S. Treasury Department.\\n\\nShifting our focus back on the technology industry, OpenAI and ChatGPT have proven to be the biggest disruptors of the AI chatbot space. In their wake, there are numerous AI chatbot models that are now available for the public to use. Two of the most widely known AI platforms are Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Bard and Elon Musk's xAI's Grok. At the same time, the potential offered by AI is not limited only to productivity tools. A significant chunk of the broader investor and corporate interest in AI - evidenced by the surge in technology and semiconductor stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) - is represented by machine learning and its transformational potential for industries.\\n\\nBill Gates is still at the center of all the hype surrounding AI, as his and other investments allowed OpenAI to demonstrate that after training a model software such as ChatGPT on vast amounts of data, it is possible to let a model make advanced outputs that are above average human intelligence. However, when we talk about the third quarter, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation made perhaps one of the biggest splashes in its recent history as it piled into stocks by the dozens as evidenced by its latest SEC filings.\\n\\nWhy is that? Well, the foundation's Q2 2023 SEC filings showed that it had made a total of 23 investments. Then, in the next quarter, these investments more than doubled as the Gates Foundation held 74 different investment stakes. In terms of their monetary value, the firm's Q2 investment portfolio was worth $42 billion and this slightly dropped to $38 billion by Q3 2023 end.\\n\\nToday we'll look at these considerable changes to the investment portfolio, with some of Bill Gates' latest investments being Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:IEF). Bill Gates Portfolio: November 2023 Update\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nTo compile our list of the latest stocks in Bill Gates' investment portfolio, we used the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's SEC filings for Q3 2023 and picked the top 12 out of its 51 latest investment additions.\\n\\nBill Gates Portfolio: November 2023 Update\\n\\n12.

But whatever happens I want you to know we have made so much progress that we are going to land it either now or later (MC13),\" hinting at the possibility of searching for a solution only by the next ministerial.\\n\\nIndia introduced a component on deep sea vessels for traditional fishermen only in 2020-21 under its flagship Rs 20,050-crore PM Matsya Sampada Yojana.\\n\\nWhile reiterating that New Delhi is keen to finalise the pact to end irrational subsidies and overfishing, India is making it clear that to achieve sustainability, big fishing subsidisers (for instance EU, US, China, Japan et al) must take greater responsibility to curtail subsidies and their fishing capacities.\\n\\nThe other formal negotiations scheduled during the four-day-long MC12 include WTO\\'s response to the pandemic, including a waiver of Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS); food security - both subjects being scheduled for June 13; fisheries subsidies and agriculture on June 14, and finally, WTO reforms and ecommerce on June 15.\\n\\n\\nG33, Bilaterals\\n\\nAt the G33 ministerial meeting, he called upon the G-33 group of developing countries work collectively and reach out to other like-minded nations to secure their support in getting a fair, balanced and development-centric outcome at the WTO which must include a permanent solution for the public stockholding and special safeguard mechanism. The G33 group includes 47 developing and least developed countries.\\n\\nThe minister said that the two items primarily on the agenda this time are a solution to public stockholding and the special safeguard mechanism to address the destabilising and crippling effects of import surges and downward price movement largely due to huge subsidies by the developed nations.\\n\\n\\n(Shantanu Sharma is in Geneva at the invitation of commerce and industry ministry', 'Final Status': 'Negative'}, {'Date_published': '2022-05-07', 'Headline': 'ET Awards 2021: RBI rate hike no surprise, though timing may be, says FM Nirmala Sitharaman', 'Synopsis': 'Speaking at the Economic Times Awards for Corporate Excellence 2021, Sitharaman said the RBI rate hike was a surprise only because it came between two meetings of the Monetary Policy Committees.', 'Full_text': \"ET Corporate Excellence Awards 2021: RBI rate hike not surprising, says FM Nirmala SitharamanFinance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the Centre hadnâ€™t been surprised by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raising interest rates this week and doesnâ€™t see the move affecting the governmentâ€™s infrastructure investment.\\n\\nâ€œIt is the timing which came as a surprise to many, but the act people thought should have been done anyway â€” to what extent could have varied,â€\\x9d she said at The Economic Times Awards for Corporate Excellence that was held in Mumbai on Saturday evening. â€œIt came as a surprise because it came between two monetary policy reviews.â€\\x9d\\n\\nShe noted that in the April policy review, RBI had indicated that it was time to act on inflation.\\n\\nSitharaman was presented with the ET Award for Business Reformer for having guided the Indian economy through the most turbulent times in recent history, at a glittering ceremony attended by top ministers and bureaucrats as well as the cream of the Indian industry.\\n\\nRBI raised interest rates for the first time in more than three years on May 4, following an unscheduled policy review to rein in prices.\\n\\nThe finance minister also said it makes perfect sense to buy oil from Russia if itâ€™s being offered to India at a discounted rate, particularly with inflation on the rise globally. â€œI thought we have been spending a lot of time explaining Indiaâ€™s position, not just on the abstentions (on Ukraine) when voting took place (at the United Nations), but also on the fact that if Russia is offering it to us at a discounted rate, we will still be buying it because it makes perfect sense, particularly when the world is stressed out with inflation,â€\\x9d she said.\\n\\n\\nBest Interests Amid Inflation\\nSitharaman said this was in the best interests of the nation when commodities prices are sending inflation higher. â€œI think we'll go ahead with what is good for the country. We need cheaper fuel. If it is available, why wonâ€™t we want to buy it? We will buy it,â€\\x9d she said.\\n\\nThe finance minister observed that she sees a greater understanding among central banks worldwide and that inflation in India isnâ€™t as much as it is in the US or the UK.\\n\\nâ€œBut still the challenge of recovery versus inflation seems to be following a particular template across the globe,â€\\x9d she said, adding that understanding how to handle the post-pandemic recovery is, therefore, not unique and typical just to India.\\n\\n\\nGST Rates\\nSitharaman ruled out any major decision on rate rationalisation at the next Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council meeting. â€œI want the media to please absorb everything that Iâ€™m saying â€” itâ€™s not happening in the next meeting obviously,â€\\x9d she said.\\n\\nOnce the rate panelâ€™s report on the issue was completed, it will be circulated in the council for discussion. â€œI would think that the committeeâ€™s report itself is not before me,â€\\x9d she said. â€œIt is too presumptuous for me to think itâ€™s going to happen in the next meeting.â€\\x9d\\n\\n\\nFood, Fertiliser Subsidy\\nThe food subsidy programme will continue as long as itâ€™s needed.\\n\\nâ€œWe did understand that till such a time as we are confident (of) recovery and are confident that the poor are able to stand up for themselves and earn their livelihood comfortably, we wanted to extend the food programme, for which the outer understanding of our limit (is) Rs 2.1-2.2 lakh crore. In a way, that calculation has been in our minds, and even during the budget preparation, that was well in our consideration zone,â€\\x9d she said.\\n\\nThe government is conscious the fertiliser subsidy may rise even this year, so farmers arenâ€™t burdened. â€œSo, to an extent, we were prepared for an additional allocation both for the (Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan) Anna Yojana and also for the fertilisers,â€\\x9d Sitharaman said.\\n\\n\\nCrypto Assets\\nThe minister said Indiaâ€™s stance on taxing crypto assets has been appreciated by multilateral agencies.\\n\\nâ€œThe concern in the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and in multilateral institutions is that because there is not enough regulatory mechanism, cryptos should not end up violating those FATF (Financial Action Task Force) norms,â€\\x9d said Sitharaman. â€œIndia took a step forward by taxing the crypto transactions and has been well receivedâ€¦ they see it as an out-of-box solution to tracking the money.â€\\x9d\\n\\n( Originally published on May 07, 2022 )In Video: \\n                ET Corporate Excellence Awards 2021: RBI rate hike not surprising, says FM Nirmala Sitharaman\", 'Final Status': 'Positive'}], notes=[])], aggregate_stats={'total_rows': 400, 'max_columns': 5, 'total_memory_usage_bytes': 1522613, 'num_files_analyzed': 1}, ai_summary='The dataset \"sentiment-analysis-labelled-financial-news-data\" consists of a single CSV file named \"Fin_Cleaned.csv\".

You can skip our detailed analysis of retirement stocks and go directly to read Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Tech Stocks To Consider.\\n\\nChalking out a financially secure retirement plan can be difficult, especially in times of financial volatility. According to a report published by Natixis Investment Managers, over 40% of the investors believe that retiring securely will be difficult, while 42% don’t take retirement as an option, considering their current financial situation.\\n\\nSafe dividend stocks with a strong history remain one of the best investment options for retirement even during volatile times. For example, shares of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) fell by 40% during the financial crisis of 2008, but the company paid regular dividends to shareholders during that time.\\n\\nAnother option to save enough money for retirement is to invest in growth stocks with strong upside potential.\\n\\nMoreover, businesses in nearly every sector deploy the recent technological advances, making way for tech stocks to rise. As reported by Deloitte, the tech industry is well-positioned to grow in 2021, given the current market situation. According to analysts, the EPS of tech stocks is expected to grow by 20% to 40% by 2025. Even during the global market meltdown in 2020 due to the Covid-19, the S&P 500’s technology index gained 43.89%, compared with other sectors such as financials and real estate which dipped 1.7% and 2.2%, respectively, as reported by S&P Global. Some of the notable and famous stocks for retirement include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO).\\n\\nOur Methodology:\\n\\nLet's analyze our list of the best retirement stocks. The companies mentioned below are the tech stocks selected on the basis of their dividend policy, future growth potential, and overall performance. In addition to this, we took into account hedge fund sentiment, analysts' ratings, and fundamentals while choosing these stocks.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nImage by pasja1000 from Pixabay\\n\\nWhy pay attention to hedge fund sentiment while choosing stocks?\\n\\nInsider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 86 percentage points since March 2017.

Additionally, the potential for a US infrastructure bill passing could be additive to an already robust spending backdrop. Gross margins should benefit as revenue mix improves as a result of their increasing exposure to higher margin software sales. ADTN also has significant operating leverage to an improving environment based on the fixed cost nature of their expenses, which should translate into accelerating earnings growth and robust free cash flow generation.”\\n\\n8.

Here is what the firm has to say:\\n\\n“Even great companies can get too expensive. In early January, we sold our long-standing position in Accenture PLC after the company’s valuation exceeded 30 times next 12 months (NTM) earnings per share (EPS). We originally invested in Accenture at the launch of the FMI International strategy at a valuation below 15 times NTM EPS and held the stock for over ten years. We added to the holding numerous times in the early years, growing the position size to as high as 5.5% in late 2014, before dialing it back in recent years as the valuation became less compelling. It is one of the world’s largest information technology services firms, specializing in helping complex, global businesses navigate disruption, and focusing on next-generation services like digital, cloud, and security. For years, the investment allowed FMI to capture the inherently higher growth of technology-related industries (GDP+) without investing directly in pure “invention-oriented” technology companies. Through Accenture we were able to avoid some of the shortfalls of tech investing: technology obsolescence, short product cycles, and subpar return on invested capital (ROIC). It grew steadily, was solidly profitable, capital-light, and generated high returns, all while maintaining a rock-solid balance sheet. It compounded its business value for many years, outperforming the MSCI EAFE indices by over 450% during our holding period. Unfortunately, the market increasingly recognized the company’s positive attributes, and the stock’s discount to intrinsic value slowly evaporated. Despite our admiration for the business, it exceeded our valuation threshold. We will continue to follow the company closely for future opportunities.”\\n\\nClick to continue reading and see the Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Tech Stocks To Consider.\\n\\nSuggested articles:\\n\\nBest Stocks To Buy For Early Retirement 10 Best Cryptocurrencies to Buy for Early Retirement 15 Dividend Stocks People Buy for Early Retirement\\n\\nDisclosure. None. Retirement Stock Portfolio: 10 Safe Tech Stocks To Consider is originally published on Insider Monkey.\", 'Tuesday, September 14, 2021\\r\\n\\r\\nSome good news on the “inflation watch” front: following last week’s higher-than-expected Producer Price Index (PPI), which indicated inflation creep was here to stay, this morning’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) — basically the other side of this inflation read’s coin — came in lower than expected for August: +0.3% on headline, beneath the +0.4% expected and the +0.5% reported for July.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the first economic print we’ve seen in recent memory that’s not pointing directly to higher inflation hitting the U.S. economy. If we strip out volatile food & energy costs, the “core” CPI read, we see growth barely moving the needle last month: +0.1%, below the +0.3% anticipated and +0.3% reported the previous month. This is the lowest monthly core CPI figure since February of this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we pull back to look at the year-over-year numbers, headline CPI is +5.3% — 10 basis points below July’s year over year, which was the highest CPI growth we’d seen in 13 years. Core year over year dropped to +4.0%, lower than the +4.3% we saw for July. For some historical comparison, June’s +4.5% was the biggest core CPI year-over-year figure we had seen in 30 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat all this means in early trading is that investors may feel a sense of reprieve that the Fed will have to move quickly to sop up this runaway inflation we’ve been seeing. Maybe Fed Chair Powell, who has held firm that inflation in our economy was “transitory” and was likely to abate once supply-demand challenges were worked out. Used Cars, which had shot up 32% earlier this year, were -1.5% last month. Air fares dipped -0.1%.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, this also may depict a setback in Services during August, as the Delta variant swept through the South like the forest fires out West (or the hurricane flooding in the East). Meaning this read may have less to do with lowering costs and more to do with a temporary economic setback caused by yet another wave of the coronavirus, at least regionally. Now that vaccinations are at last gaining favor in certain sectors, we may see CPI numbers back up where they had been.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn any case, pre-market futures reversed on this release: from wallowing in the red, post-CPI we saw the Dow jump to +140 points, the S&P 500 +20 and the Nasdaq +65. Since then, we have seen these numbers cool a bit, but remain firmly in the green. Next week is the next meeting for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), and investors had been looking toward Powell’s press conference as the time we hear about a tapering timeline. Perhaps now they’ll reconsider.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 11am PT today, Apple AAPL is expected to unveil its latest iPhone — the 13. These events, basically yearly as they now are, are not quite the scintillating occurrences that move Apple’s share price and thus the market. Part of this is because Apple is now so gigantic it’s hard to make those big jumps any longer. Similarly for the iPhone itself — it’s such a universal tool these days, there are few surprises even possible to present. Apple has underperformed the S&P 500 year to date.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

If you want to skip our introduction to the technology billionaire and how his investments are shaping the world as we know today, then take a look at Bill Gates Portfolio: November 2023 Update - Top 5 Stocks.\\n\\nBill Gates' fame and money come via having caught on to the personal computing industry when the sector was in its infancy. His company, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the biggest technology companies in the world. At the root of Microsoft's success is the world changing computer science industry, which has managed to put a computer, in one form or the other, in the hands of millions of people worldwide.\\n\\nWhile Mr. Gates has moved away from his trillion dollar firm, 2023 has been a year shaped by his decisions. This applies to both the stock market and the broader technology scene. Mr. Gates and his relationship with OpenAI have contributed to the rise of the world's most heavily trained artificial intelligence model ChatGPT. In turn, ChatGPT's progress has injected fervor into technology stocks, which needed a pick me up after the devastation to the market ushered in 2022 through the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the monetary policy effects of the coronavirus era.\\n\\nAccording to the latest estimates, Bill Gates is currently worth $116 billion as of November 2023. Most of his wealth comes through his Microsoft shares, both indirectly and directly. Mr. Gates' capital is also held up in the investment firm Cascade Investment L.L.C., a private investment firm headquartered in Kirkland, Washington. Billionaires like Bill Gates don't just simply invest in companies or organizations through the money in their personally held bank accounts. Instead, they structure their investments through companies for several benefits. Cascade is closely related to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the two organizations share Cascade's chief investment officer Michael Larson.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nLike the Bill Gates Foundation, Cascade also files with the SEC. Its latest filing came in July 2023 and revealed that the firm had owned 9.8 million shares of AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN). The shares opened at $157 on July 28th, implying that Bill Gates' investment in the Floridian car retailer was worth approximately $1.5 billion as of the time of the filing. Since the holding was disclosed, the stock has dipped and the shares are currently trading for $131.97. Another investment of the financial firm, often also called Bill Gates' family office, is the Western Asset Inflation-Linked Income Fund (NYSE:WIA). This fund invests primarily in inflation linked securities issued by the U.S. Treasury Department.\\n\\nShifting our focus back on the technology industry, OpenAI and ChatGPT have proven to be the biggest disruptors of the AI chatbot space. In their wake, there are numerous AI chatbot models that are now available for the public to use. Two of the most widely known AI platforms are Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Bard and Elon Musk's xAI's Grok. At the same time, the potential offered by AI is not limited only to productivity tools. A significant chunk of the broader investor and corporate interest in AI - evidenced by the surge in technology and semiconductor stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) - is represented by machine learning and its transformational potential for industries.\\n\\nBill Gates is still at the center of all the hype surrounding AI, as his and other investments allowed OpenAI to demonstrate that after training a model software such as ChatGPT on vast amounts of data, it is possible to let a model make advanced outputs that are above average human intelligence. However, when we talk about the third quarter, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation made perhaps one of the biggest splashes in its recent history as it piled into stocks by the dozens as evidenced by its latest SEC filings.\\n\\nWhy is that? Well, the foundation's Q2 2023 SEC filings showed that it had made a total of 23 investments. Then, in the next quarter, these investments more than doubled as the Gates Foundation held 74 different investment stakes. In terms of their monetary value, the firm's Q2 investment portfolio was worth $42 billion and this slightly dropped to $38 billion by Q3 2023 end.\\n\\nToday we'll look at these considerable changes to the investment portfolio, with some of Bill Gates' latest investments being Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:IEF). Bill Gates Portfolio: November 2023 Update\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nTo compile our list of the latest stocks in Bill Gates' investment portfolio, we used the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's SEC filings for Q3 2023 and picked the top 12 out of its 51 latest investment additions.\\n\\nBill Gates Portfolio: November 2023 Update\\n\\n12.
